Welcome to Flatpak's documentation!
===================================

This documentation covers everything you need to know to build and distribute

background information on basic concepts, and a guide to the Flatpak command-line
interface. Later sections provide detailed information on building and
distributing applications.

This documentation is primarily intended for application developers and distributors.
However, it is also relevant to anyone with a general interest in Flatpak.
