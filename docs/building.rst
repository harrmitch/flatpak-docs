Building
========

This section provides detailed information on how to build applications as
flatpaks. It starts with an overview of the build process, followed by
requirements for applications, guidance on key decisions, information
on using ``flatpak-builder``, and instructions on writing manifest files.

If you haven't already, it is recommended to run through :doc:`first-build`
before reading this section.
